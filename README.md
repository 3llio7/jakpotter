A tool that creates free trial accounts on alphaSMS bd with random credentials.

This tool generates a random email and a random number to create a account. I bruteforces the otp to authenticate. I uses multi threading to the process is fairly fast.
It will get you 2.5 bdt to send sms to any number.

UPDATE: they have changed the terms, Now with the trial 2.5 bdt, you can only send sms to the number the account was created.
